explaination of the packages in this work space

1)robot_setup_tf : 

this package converts lidar , wheel incoder's frame to base link frame
		 
eg .this means this package represents base_laser frame in terms of base_link frame

working is below

taking points in the "base_laser" frame and transforming them to the "base_link" frame. The first thing we need to do is to create a node that will be responsible for publishing the 			transforms in our system. Next, we'll have to create a node to listen to the transform data published over ROS and apply it to transform a point. We'll start by creating a package for the 		source code to live in and we'll give it a simple name like "robot_setup_tf"

like ...
base_laser: (1.00, 0.20. 0.00) -----> base_link: (1.10, 0.20, 0.20) at time 1567092603.49 

timestamp is imp coz they may have RELATIVE MOTION BETWEEN THEM


2) lidar :

publish lidar data to a topic called senso_msgs/LaserScan
currently we made a function inside the file to publish fake lidar values as we dont have real lidar as of now !


3) odometry : 
for publishing odometry information for the navigation stack. It covers both publishing the nav_msgs/Odometry message over ROS, and a 
transform from a "odom" coordinate frame to a "base_link" coordinate frame over tf.
